## 🩸 Menstrual cycle: from mithology to modern medicine 

This project explores the biology and cultural perceptions of menstruation. It begins with a clear explanation of the menstrual cycle and then focuses on two common yet under-researched disorders: endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Initially, we intended to look for clinical data; however, we soon realized that there was limited real data available to support a project like this. Thus, we crafted a narrative to illustrate how data could enhance our understanding of these conditions—if only it were real.

Our conclusion reflects on the gaps in scientific and medical knowledge, particularly regarding diseases that affect a significant percentage of the global population. In short, what we know is minimal, and what we don’t know remains largely overlooked.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Most of the data used in this project is synthetic — real, accessible datasets on menstrual health are scarce.
- Research around reproductive system disorders is overwhelmingly focused on fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth, rather than overall well-being.
- An estimated 1.9 billion women are of reproductive age worldwide. Around 10% suffer from endometriosis, and 6–13% from PCOS.
- Diagnostic criteria for PCOS are recent, inconsistently applied, and widely debated.
- Endometriosis is a common disease with limited visibility in clinical practice, despite its high prevalence.
- Menstrual-related disorders are poorly represented in official diagnostic glossaries and healthcare records.
